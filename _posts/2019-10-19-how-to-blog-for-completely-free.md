Think about the stories you read in a newspaper: for each
story, there will be a headline, some text, and possibly some
images. If the article is a long piece, there may be subheadings
that split the story into separate sections or quotes from those
involved. Structure helps readers understand the stories in the
newspaper.

Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's
screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies
the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser
window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates
the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser
window is wide.
